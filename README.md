SaiBook is a web app that allows users to add a virtual book of bhajans (Indian songs) with customizable titles and lyrics. This app will help keep a track of all the bhajans that a user has learned and put them in a place that they can always refer to when a physical book is not readily available. I want to expand this app to allow for users to upload audio files and work towards creating a login functionality to better save user data
